Title: freenode #live!
---
freenode #live is a community-focused live event designed to **build** and **strengthen** relationships between Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) developers and users. freenode live seeks to raise awareness of and promote FOSS alternatives to proprietary software. Facilitating face-to-face interaction, creative workshops, talks and think tanks, freenode live will bring developers and users together in a nurturing and dynamic environment stimulating the free exchange of ideas and information while fostering cross-project collaboration and dialogue for innovation. 

The inaugural freenode #live conference takes place at At-Bristol in Bristol, UK from Saturday 28 to Sunday 29 October 2017. Both days will include talks and workshops, and we look forward to seeing you at this community-focused gathering.

[Tickets are now on sale](https://freenode.live/conference/fn-live17/register/new) and we are taking [submissions for the call for participation](https://freenode.live/conference/fn-live17/program/proposal/new) and look forward to receiving yours.

We will be making every effort to ensure that freenode #live is as inclusive an event as is possible and we encourage the minorities within our community to attend and submit proposals.

The freenode #live venue is fully wheelchair-accessible and there is step-free access from the street, car parks and to all venue spaces.

We are keen to ensure that freenode #live is welcoming and inclusive of all, including the next generation of geeks. With that in mind, we will be providing a crèche staffed by qualified childminders during conference hours. If you wish to use the crèche or book your child onto a scheduled tour of At-Bristol and the Aquarium, please do let us know in good time as spaces are limited.

Children will be welcome at all appropriate conference events including in the audience during talks.

If you are breastfeeding your baby, you are welcome to feed your baby whenever and wherever you like, including during talks. freenode #live will provide a friendly and welcoming environment for parents and children.

# Code of Conduct

On freenode, we believe that most of our users are intelligent and well-intended and we are loathe to tell people what to do, and just as we have expectations for conduct on the freenode network, we also have expectations for conduct at our live conferences. We will not condone harassment or offensive behaviour, on the freenode network or at our conference venues. 

The focus of freenode is on collaboration and community, and we ask that you help us make the freenode #live conference a place where all participants, regardless of race, gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, nationality, ethnicity, political affiliation or religion are feel welcome and included. freenode #live is an extension of the freenode network and we encourage networking and community enrichment and we will not tolerate harassment of any participants in any form - in person or online.

Examples include offensive comments, verbal or written threats or demands, unwanted sexualised behaviour in public or private spaces, intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recordings, sustained session or event disruption and unwelcome physical contact or sexual attention. 

We expect all participants (attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers) to follow this Code of Conduct during the confeerence, including at conference-related social events at off-site venues, online communities and social media. Any participant who is asked to stop behaviour that can be perceived as harassment will be expected to comply immediately and violation may result in the participant being expelled from the conference and/or banned from future events.

On the event that you have any concerns during the conference, please do contact any freenode volunteer or venue staff. Thank you for helping us keep the event welcome and respectful for everyone.
